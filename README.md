# Quick Annotator
---
Quick Annotator is an open-source digital pathology annotation tool.

# Purpose
---
Machine learning approaches for segmentation of histologic primitives (e.g., cell nuclei) in digital 
pathology (DP) Whole Slide Images (WSI) require large numbers of exemplars. Unfortunately, annotating 
each object is laborious and often intractable even in moderately sized cohorts. 
The purpose of the quick annotator is to rapidly bootstrap annotation creation for digital
pathology projects by helping identify images and small regions.

Because the classifier is likely to struggle by intentionally focusing in these areas, 
less pixel level annotations are needed, which significantly improves the efficiency of the users.
Our approach involves updating a u-net model while the user provides annotations, so the model is
then in real time used to produce. This allows the user to either accept or modify regions of the 
prediction.

# Requirements
---
Tested with Python 3.8

Requires:
1. Python 
2. pip

And the following additional python package:
1. Flask_SQLAlchemy
2. scikit_image
3. scikit_learn
4. opencv_python_headless
5. scipy
6. requests
7. SQLAlchemy
8. torch
9. torchvision
10.Flask_Restless
11. numpy
12. Flask
13. umap_learn
14. Pillow
15. tensorboardX
16. ttach
17. albumentations
18. config

You can likely install the python requirements using something like (note python 3+ requirement):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
The library versions have been pegged to the current validated ones. 
Later versions are likely to work but may not allow for cross-site/version reproducibility

We received some feedback that users could installed *torch*. Here, we provide a detailed guide to install
*Torch*
### Torch's Installation
The general guides for installing Pytorch can be summarized as following:
1. Check your NVIDIA GPU Compute Capability @ *https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus* 
2. Download CUDA Toolkit @ *https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads* 
3. Install PyTorch command can be found @ *https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/* 


# Basic Usage
---
see [UserManual](http://hawking.case.edu:3030/deeplearning/quick_annotator/blob/master/wiki.md#user-manual) for a demo
### Run
```
 E:\Study\Research\QA\qqqqq\test1\quick_annotator>python QA.py
```
By default, it will start up on localhost:5555

### Config Sections
There are many modular functions in QA whose behaviors could be adjusted by hyper-parameters. These hyper-parameters can 
be set in the *config.ini* file

Information from Quick Annotator users appears below:
1. QA current does not support WSI. All the images tiles will be converted to png file when uploading to QA.
